# LetsDefend Lab: SOC168 - OS Command Injection Investigation

## **Objective**  
The objective of this lab is to detect and respond to an **OS Command Injection attack** by:  
1. Analyzing logs to identify malicious requests and payloads.  
2. Assessing the attackâ€™s success and determining its impact.  
3. Implementing containment measures and documenting IOCs for future prevention.


### **Skills Learned**  
- Analyzing HTTP POST requests and identifying OS Command Injection payloads.  
- Validating IP reputation using threat intelligence tools.  
- Containing compromised systems and documenting Indicators of Compromise (IOCs).  
- Applying incident response techniques to mitigate risks.  


### **Tools Used**  
- **Log Management Systems** for analyzing suspicious traffic.  
- **Threat Intelligence Platforms** (e.g., VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB) for validating IP reputation.  
- **HTTP and Network Monitoring Tools** for tracing malicious requests and actions.

## Steps
### Intro to Alert

Lets grab the alert details

### Case Creation

Create Case

Start Playbook

### Understand the Alert

	Q) Why was it triggered?

Check Alert details for this

	A) Request body contains whoami string

	Q) Which two devices is the traffic occuring? What protocol is used between devices, etc?

Lets look at the source and destination IPs

For the source IP we'll use VirusTotal

Looks like its a malicious actor coming from China

Community notes also confirms this

Now lets look at our log files

Here's the query in question, although the threat actor made several other attempts with various payloads as well

From the alert details, we know that the destination IP address is our WebServer1004

So for the answer to the prompt is:

	A) Threat actor located in China (61.177.172.87) -> Webserver1004 (172.16.17.16), over port 443 (HTTPS), POST request method 

### Collect Data

We've already done most of this, lets see what we stil need

We can review VirusTotal for this

	Q) Ownership of IP addresses and Devices
	A) ChinaNet Jiangsu Province Network. 

	Q) Coming from internet
	A) Yes

	Q) Static or pooled?
	A) Pooled

	Q) Reputation?
	A) Malicious

### Examine HTTP Traffic

We briefly looked at this in the logs earlier

![Image 9](https://i.imgur.com/Uxj8NdL.png)

	Q) Malicious?
	A) Yes

![Image 10](https://i.imgur.com/449uRgm.png)

	Q) What type of attack?
	A) Command Injection

![Image 11](https://i.imgur.com/15ZTw54.png)

	Q) Is it a planned test?

Since we already determined the traffic is malicious and coming from outside our network we know it is not planned

	A) Not planned

	Q) Direction of Traffic?
	A) Internet -> Company network

	Q) Was the attack successful? 

Lets take a look at the endpoint to determine wether or not the commands were executed

Unfortunately, it looks like the attack was successful

![Image 15](https://i.imgur.com/ZgJzgji.png)

	A) Yes 

### Containment

	Q) Tier 2 Escalation?

Since the attack was successful, yes

	A) Yes

Create you analyst note
